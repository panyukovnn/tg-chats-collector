# Java AI Rules for code generation

- Prepare checkbox plan for every new feature, before realization, and ask user about its correctness.
- The existing code structure must not be changed without a strong reason.
- Minor inconsistencies and typos in the existing code may be fixed.
- Every bug must be reproduced by a unit test before being fixed.
- Every new feature must be covered by a unit test before it is implemented.
- Create `impl` package for service interfaces implementation classes.

- Immutable objects must be favored over mutable ones.
- Methods must never return null.
- Methods should avoid checking incoming arguments for validity, except methods in utility classes.
- null may not be passed as an argument.
- Reflection on object internals is strictly prohibited.
- Exception messages must include as much context as possible.
- Always keep backward compatibility of external API
- Code must be as simple as possible for understanding.
- Call linters checks after finishing the user task and fix all founded issues, instruction to run linters is here: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/panyukovnn/handbook/refs/heads/main/java/linters.md

## Additional instructions

- For unit tests use unit-tester subagent (if possible), otherwise use rules from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/panyukovnn/handbook/refs/heads/main/java/unit-tests-ai-rules.md
- For liquibase scripts creation use rules from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/panyukovnn/handbook/refs/heads/main/java/liquibase-ai-rules.md
- For entity classes use rules from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/panyukovnn/handbook/refs/heads/main/java/entity-class-ai-rules.md
- For dto classes use rules from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/panyukovnn/handbook/refs/heads/main/java/dto-class-ai-rules.md
- For api design use rules from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/panyukovnn/handbook/refs/heads/main/common/api-requirements-ai-rules.md
- For exception handling use rules from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/panyukovnn/handbook/refs/heads/main/java/exception-handling-ai-rules.md
- For kafka integration use rules from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/panyukovnn/handbook/refs/heads/main/java/kafka-integration-ai-rules.md

## Code Style

- Lines MUST NOT exceed 250 characters.
- Method length MUST NOT exceed 20 lines; only trivial easy-to-read methods MAY exceed this limit.
- Class length MUST NOT exceed 250 lines.
- Methods with more than 7 arguments MUST group arguments into a dedicated wrapper type (prefer an inner record/static class).
- If the project already uses classic DTO classes, records MUST NOT replace them; records MAY be used in projects, that have already adopted records widely, or as inner static aggregators for arguments/return values.
- Enum constants MUST be in UPPER_SNAKE_CASE and each value MUST be on a new line.
- Enums with fields MUST use @Getter and @RequiredArgsConstructor.
- Long expressions MUST be wrapped with line breaks before operators and after commas in argument lists.
- Wrapped lines MUST either align with the previous expression start or be indented by 8 spaces.
- A blank line MUST appear before every return statement.
- A blank line MUST appear after closing braces (unless it is the end of a method).
- A blank line MUST appear before each control construct (if/for/try/etc.).
- A blank line MUST appear after constants, after fields, between methods, after the class declaration, and after the import block.
- Extra blank lines between consecutive fields MUST NOT be added.
- Complex boolean expressions and long call chains MUST be extracted into clearly named variables or methods.
- Curly braces MUST be used for all single-line statements.
- Classic switch statements MUST end each case with break.
- On Java 21+, modern switch expressions with exhaustiveness and pattern matching MUST be preferred; a default or exhaustive handling MUST be present.
- The var keyword MUST NOT be used in production code, if it is not already used in project.
- If var is adopted by project convention, var MUST be used only where the type is obvious (object creation/builder) and MUST NOT be used for method results or Stream API chains.
- Constants used fewer than two times MUST NOT be extracted unless extraction clearly improves readability.
- Shared constants used across modules MUST be placed in util package classes grouped by meaning, MUST have a private constructor, and MUST contain no state or logic.
- Field order MUST be: static first, then non-static.
- Field access order MUST be: private, package-private, protected, public.
- Method order MUST be: public, protected, package-private, private.
- Functional call chains MUST be split across lines (one step per line where practical).
- In equals comparisons, the left operand MUST be a known non-null value (e.g., a constant or enum literal).
- Javadoc and comments MUST be written in Russian.
- Classes and interfaces MUST be documented; methods/fields with non-obvious logic MUST be documented; @Override methods MUST NOT be documented.
- Private methods MUST be documented when needed to clarify the contract.
- Empty method implementations MUST contain an explicit comment stating no implementation is required.
- Comments explaining intentionally non-obvious logic MUST be present; superfluous comments MUST be avoided.
- SQL keywords MUST be UPPERCASE; SQL MUST be formatted multi-line and readably.
- Error and log messages must always be a single sentence, with no periods inside.
- Code MUST NOT contain magic numbers, all values, which may be dynamicly changed must be written in application.yml

## Naming

- Names MUST be specific, self-explanatory, and answer what/why/how;
- Digits in names MUST NOT be used, except repetitive objects in tests.
- HTTP endpoint paths MUST be kebab-case.
- URL path params and query params MUST be camelCase.
- JSON field names MUST be camelCase.
- JSON enum values MUST be UPPER_SNAKE_CASE.
- Package names MUST be lowercase without underscores or hyphens; compound words MUST be concatenated.
- The base package MUST start with the project group-id and end with the microservice name.
- Abbreviations in package names MUST NOT be used (use controller, exception, not ctrl, ex).
- Subpackages MUST reflect logical grouping; one nesting level SHOULD be used for simple groupings; deeper levels MUST be justified by clear necessity.
- Project code MUST be organized into conventional packages (e.g., aspect, client, config, controller, dto, exception, listener, mapper, model, property, repository, scheduler, service with domain, util, webfilter).
- Method names MUST be camelCase and begin with a verb that reflects the action.
- Variables and fields MUST be camelCase; constants MUST be UPPER_SNAKE_CASE.
- Names MUST be nouns for data holders; boolean field names MUST NOT start with is/has.
- Names MUST NOT be based on current literal content; names MUST reflect purpose/role of containing data.
- Collection variables MUST use plural nouns; time-interval variables MUST include time units (e.g., ttlHours).
- Enum constant names MUST be UPPER_SNAKE_CASE with one value per line.
- Class and interface names MUST be PascalCase, be domain nouns, be unique project-wide, and reflect purpose.
- Entity class names MUST match DB table names; when conflicts occur, the Entity suffix MAY be used.
- Exception class names MUST end with the Exception suffix.
- Enum type names MUST NOT end with Enum; record type names MUST NOT end with Record.
- Class names MUST NOT be vague/common words (Helper, Manager, Service, Scheduler) and MUST NOT clash with framework/library class names (Controller, Validator, KafkaListener, etc.).
- Configuration file names (YML/properties/XML) MUST be kebab-case; YAML files SHOULD use the .yml extension consistently within the project.
- Liquibase migration and SQL file names MUST be snake_case.
- Properties keys in YAML MUST be kebab-case or camelCase consistently; related settings MUST be grouped under a common prefix; units MUST be included in names where applicable; each group MUST have its own @ConfigurationProperties class.
- Database identifiers MUST be snake_case and MUST avoid SQL/DB reserved words and generic terms.
- Table names MUST be nouns (singular preferred unless team conventions differ).
- Many-to-many join tables MUST be named table1_table2 with logical or alphabetical order; the second table name MAY be plural when appropriate.
- Column names MUST be nouns reflecting stored data; foreign keys MUST follow `<table>_id` naming.
- Indexes and constraints MUST follow the prefix_table_column1_column2 pattern; allowed prefixes: pkey_, key_, excl_, idx_, fkey_, check_.
